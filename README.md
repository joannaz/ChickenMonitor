# SmartChickens

The visualisation web aspect of my final year project. 


#### Branches

###### Master

This is the default branch that was submitted. It uses JWT to authenticate with an express.js backend. More info can be found [here](https://joannaz.github.io/corpus/#header-n4366).

###### Staging

To get this to work with GitHub pages (without hosting a separate backend), I am re-writing all the services to return dummy data to the application.
